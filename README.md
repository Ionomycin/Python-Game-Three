# Python-Game-Three
Reading and writing files in different Python environments.

In this program, you will notice I used PyCharm. This is a convienent IDE designed SPECICIALLY for Python programmers. You can use EITHER IDLE or PyCharm. I have made it compatible for both without any issues. I will always supply how to install IDLE and I will do the same for PyCharm as well now.

INSTALLING AND USING IDLE (NOT PYCHARM):
1. Install IDLE First Before Doing This. MAKE SURE IT'S IDLE. It's free. I use the Python 3.8.1 Shell. Below is the link to it.
2. https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381/
3. Scroll all the way down on the above link and you'll find the downloadable packages. Choose the one SPECIFIC TO YOUR OS.
4. Once installed, you can download/copy the .py file I have programmed.
5. Use file > open > (find my .py file) to load my program into IDLE. Alternatively, you should be able to double-click my file on your desktop and it should open in IDLE without a problem, but if it does, use the first way I mentioned.
6. To run the program, click "Run > Run Module" in the top navigation bar. It may have you save the document. If this happens, click "Save" and it should automatically execute my program.
7. That's all there is to it! This will be how you run ALL of my programs. Any additional materials will ALWAYS be provided and I will explain how to use them step by step.

INSTALLING AND USING PYCHARM (NOT IDLE):
1. Install PyCharm Before Doing This. It's free. The PyCharm environment uses the most updated version of the IDLE Shell (3.8.1 currently). Below is the link to PyCharm.
2. https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows (MAKE SURE you choose the OS you're using). They offer Windows, Mac OS, and Linux versions. Choose the "Community" version as you do not need to pay for the professional software.

3. Follow the installation wizard for PyCharm. Their recommendations are usually the best way to go about installing the software, but you DO NOT HAVE TO if you don't want to.
4. Once installed, you can download/copy the .py file I have programmed.

5. Open up the PyCharm IDE. It's very confusing at first so let me walk you through how ALL my programs will be run through.
6. Click: File > New Project > Replace "Untitled" with a name for the project folder > Click "Create" > The project folder will be created and you will be dropped into it. > Once in the project folder, go back to "File."

7. There are two ways you can import my file into PyCharm. 

8. IF YOU DOWNLOADED AND SAVED THE FILE TO THE DESKTOP OF YOUR COMPUTER DO THE FOLLOWING: File > Open > Search for my .py document > Click "Open."
9. IF YOU ARE COPYING MY FILE, DO THE FOLLOWING: File > New > File > Name the file whatever you'd like > Press Enter > Click outside of the file name box and instaed click the huge list of file options, scroll up to Python (NOT PYTHON STUB) > Select "Python" > Click "Ok" > It will create the file > Copy and paste my .py contents into that file.

10. To RUN my programs: Go to the top navigation bar > Run > Run 'File_Name_You_Supplied.' If it pops up with another box verifying the run, press enter and it will start my program. You can stop my program at anytime by using the red "Stop" button on the top right corner next to the search magnifying glass.

Enjoy

The program I have coded, will take user input and write it to a file that has a name of your choice. Error checking is embedded inside of the attempt system. Program IS case-insensitive.

**Things you can change:**
Nothing currently. You can definetely experiment around with it if you wish it's rather a simplistic program.
